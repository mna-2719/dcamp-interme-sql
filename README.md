# Intermediate SQL

This intermediate-level course taught me several key functions necessary to wrangle, filter, and categorize information in a relational database, expand my SQL toolkit, and answer complex questions. I learned the robust use of CASE statements, subqueries, and window functionsâ€”all while discovering some interesting facts about soccer using the European Soccer Database.
